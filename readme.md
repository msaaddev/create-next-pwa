A cross-platform Node.js based CLI tool that creates **Progressive Web App (PWA)** with **Next.js**. You can also integrate **tailwind** with the Next.js PWA using this CLI with a single command.

>Note: If you are on Windows, make sure you either use Command Prompt or Windows Powershell to run the CLI.

## 🎯 Features

- Generates boilerplate code for **Next.js PWA** with a single command
- **Tailwind** integration with the Next.js PWA
- Integrated **Prettier** to easily format the code with `npm run format`

## 📦 Installation

```sh
# install the CLI globally
npm i -g create-next-pwa

# use it with npx (recommended)
npx create-next-pwa [app_name]
```

## 🚀 Usage

Navigate to the folder you want to have your Next.js PWA.

```sh
# using npx
npx create-next-pwa@latest [app_name]

# if you have installed globally
create-next-pwa [app_name]

# Next.js PWA with tailwind integration using npx
npx create-next-pwa@latest [app_name] --tailwind

# Next.js PWA with tailwind integration if you have globally installed the CLI
create-next-pwa [app_name] --tailwind

# without giving app name in terminal using npx
npx create-next-pwa@latest

# without giving app name in terminal using npx and tailwind integration
npx create-next-pwa@latest --tailwind

# without giving app name in terminal if installed globally
create-next-pwa

# without giving app name in terminal if install globally along with tailwind integration
create-next-pwa --tailwind
```

## 🎩 Demo

# using npx

## 👨🏻‍💻 Contributing

Make sure you read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/msaaddev/create-next-pwa/blob/master/contributing.md) before opening a PR. If you want something else to **integrate** with the CLI like I have done with tailwind, open an issue in the repository and I will get back to it.
